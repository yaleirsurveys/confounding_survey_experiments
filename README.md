Confounding in Survey Experiments: Democratic Peace Survey Data & Code
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yaleirsurveys/confounding_survey_experiments.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yaleirsurveys/confounding_survey_experiments)

The primary statement of our analysis plan is in our pre-analysis plan in Open Science Foundation Storage. In this GitHub repo, we have also included partially complete code and simulated data related to our pre-analysis plan in our GitHub repository; the pre-analysis plan supersedes the code in any areas of ambiguity or difference. 

All the R code is in the `R` folder and all the data are in the `inst/extdata` folder. The file "data/confounding_survey4.R" contains the code for the primary analysis using simulated data. You can run it as a function; to save images generated by the function, please specify a directory.
