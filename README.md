Confounding in Survey Experiments: Democratic Peace Survey Data & Code
===================

This GitHub repo contains data and code for the democratic peace survey in "Confounding in Survey Experiments." All the R code is in the `R` folder and all the data are in the `data` folder. Images generated as part of the analysis will be saved to the `images` folder. 

The file "data/confounding_survey4.R" contains the code for the primary analysis using simulated data. This is intended as a supplement to our pre-analysis plan. The code for the analysis of our actual data might be slightly different.
