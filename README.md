Confounding in Survey Experiments: Democratic Peace Survey Data & Code
===================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/yaleirsurveys/confounding_survey_experiments.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/yaleirsurveys/confounding_survey_experiments)

This GitHub repo contains code and data for the democratic peace survey in "Confounding in Survey Experiments." This is intended as a supplement to our pre-analysis plan. All the R code is in the `R` folder and all the data are in the `inst/extdata` folder. The code for the analysis of our actual data might be slightly different. Note that the survey data we include are simulated using Qualtrics. 

The file "data/confounding_survey4.R" contains the code for the primary analysis using simulated data. You can run it as a function; to save images generated by the function, please specify a directory.
